# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

## Problem Statement
Given the array `nums` after the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return the index of `target` if it is in `nums`, or -1 if it is not in `nums`.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

## Solutions
- `solution.java`: Java implementation using binary search and pivot finding.
- `solution.c`: C implementation using binary search and pivot finding.
- `solution.cpp`: C++ implementation using binary search and pivot finding.
- `solution.py`: Python implementation using binary search and pivot finding.
